title: Minimal blog
published: 2024-05-06

The least possible blog is a page per post with title and body text, and 
an index page that has a reverse-chronological list of links to posts. Without
adding support for static files the options for styling the pages are very
limited, but we can embed a stylesheet in the pages for a first approximation.

the least possible implementation is a command, which for now is `mismiy`
(pronounced ‘miss me?’). It consumes _posts_ (in [Markdown][] prefixed with YAML
metadata) and templates (in [Mustache][] format) and writes HTML. By default
these are files in directories named `posts`, `partials`, and `pub`.

```sh
mismiy -o pub -p partials posts
```

You can view the result as a web site by, for example, running Python’s
simple web server there:

```sh
cd pub; python -m http.server
```

The code is written in Python in test-first fashion, though the code is pretty
simple so far—I spent more time trying to decide which Markdown library to
use than writing the code that uses it.

Obvious future features include:
- static files, such a style sheets;
- other data, such as a blogroll;
- non-post pages, such as an about page;
- a ‘watch’ mode for `mismiy` that regenerates the blog when files are edted;
- publication dates, controlling when posts are publicly visible;
- feeds;
- tags and categorization.
