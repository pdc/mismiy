title: Release 0.1.0

Itâ€™s about time we had a release so that we can move towards making Mismiy
installable, which in turn would make it possible to provide instructions for
setting up a blog that are less primitive.

To that end I have been drafting a more extensive readme and creating a changelog.
The format of the latter is broadly based on the suggestions in [Keep a Changelog].
I have dithered for a bit over whether to call this version 0.1.0 or 1.0.0.
I think for now I plan to reserve the latter for when I have something I think
makes sense to upload to PyPI.
