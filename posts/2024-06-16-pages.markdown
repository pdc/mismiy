title: Pages that are not posts
author: Damian Cugley

Even a basic blog needs some non-post pages (an about page, perhaps a
[a privacy policy]). Or we could use Mismiy to generate arbitrary
documention hierarchies, with the blog posts being just a little
feature on the side.

We already load posts from any directory hierarchy so
`2024/06/15/blah.markdown` can be used to provide slashier URLs than
with `2024-06-15-blah.markdown`, so our non-post pages can do that
same. The only real difference is whether they are included in the
index pageâ€™s reverse chronological order and the atom feed. So this new
feature basically boils down to making _posts_ a special type
of _page_.

The new schema is as follows: first, there will be more than
one _source_ of pages, each a directory containing `.markdown` files.
So we might have `posts` and `pages` directories, for example. These
get merged together on the generated site, so they better use
non-overlapping file names.

Second, sources have an property named _kind_ that is either `page`
(the default), or a special kind of page, of which our only example so
far is `post`. The _kind_ property is set explictly in in the
`meta.yaml` file, or failing that, the `posts` directory will have kind
`post`, and any other will be `page`.

The kind of page controls the templates used for rendering pages
(`post.html.mustache` vesus `page.html.mustache`). The index template
will need to link to both kinds of content but fir a first version it
is probably OK to hard-code links in to the template.

Feed files will be created for `post` sources. For now we assume one
feed for all posts. Same for the reverse-chonological list of posts on
the index. I can work out how to do multi-feed sites when I find I have
a need for one.
