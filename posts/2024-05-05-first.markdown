title: Test post for Mismiy

This is the first post for Mismiy, yet another static blog generator.

My aim is to make a minimalistic blog maker using:

- Mustache for templating layouts (Python package: Chevron)
- Markdown for converting text to HTML (Python package: mistletoe)
- Strict yaml for post metadata (Python package: strictyaml)

No need for CSS generators like LESS; modern CSS is powerful enough we donâ€™t need it.

Future iterations will add more metadata and allow for other sources of data.
