title: Watch mode for mismiy
author: Damian Cugley

The `mismiy` command now has a `--watch` option that causes it to monitor
the posts and partials directories for changes, and re-renders the site
when files are modified, added, or deleted. The idea is you run 

    mismiy posts --watch

in one window, and the web server in another, and then as you edit the posts
or the templates, the site is kept up to date. You still need to refresh
the page in the browser to see changes.
